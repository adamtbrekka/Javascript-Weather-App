# Javascript-Weather-App

BEFORE YOU USE THIS APP, register for an API key at http://api.wunderground.com/api , and then place that key (pure string) into /api.json.

Once that's done, you can type "node app.js" in your terminal followed by a zip code or city / state input.

For example: "node app.js 90210" or "node app.js Beverly Hills CA".
Weather will be logged to the terminal.
